# About SummerProject2013
This is a fork of Kor8der's SummerProject2013 (also called sp13). A roguelike 
verymuch in development yet.

# Dependencies
sp13 uses Simple and Fast Multimedia Library version 2.0, and Microsoft Visual 
Studio or SCons <http://www.scons.org/> for building.

# Installing and running

## GNU/Linux
From the project root do:

```sh
cd summerProject2013
scons  			# I usually add -j<number-of-cpu-cores> on this one
./sp13 			# runs the game
```

## Windows
### SCons
See GNU/Linux, powershell and SCons worked the same way for me 
(thomassigurdsen) when I tried building it on an MS Windows machine.

### Microsoft Visual Studio
It is apparently possible to build this sourcecode with Visual Studio, I 
(thomassigurdsen) haven't tried (I hear there is some fishy business with 
"release mode", but I don't know).
TODO: write up this section.

## Mac
See GNU/Linux, thomassigurdsen would assume it works with bash and SCons just 
as with Linux.

# Licensing and Legalese
TODO: see <https://github.com/kor8der/SummerProject2013/issues/2>
